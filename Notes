#Store

create store with root reducer and default state
store needs default data

#Actions

action creators go in its own actions folder- functions to fire off actions- minimal info as possible
i.e.

function action( minimal info ){
	return
	{
		type: 'ACTION',
		minimal,
		info
	}
}

#Reducer

there is a reducer for every piece of state
reducer takes in two things

 2 copy of state aka store
reducer does work, and returns 
  updated copy of state   aka new store
